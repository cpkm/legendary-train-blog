I am a passionate and motivated person who has been an active researcher for 6+ years. Most recently I studied at the University of Toronto, where my research was focused on high-power and ultrafast laser system development. Previously I've studied at the University of Alberta and the University of Guelph in a range of fields including Condensed Matter Physics, Materials Chemistry and Biophysics. Most recently I taught Solid-state Physics as a Sessional Lecturer at the University of Guelph.
