#### Role: Lab instructor

This is a practical course that further develops the core experimental and computational skills
necessary to do Physics: mathematical models, computational simulations and solutions,
experimental measurements, data and error analysis. Students are working in a team of two or three
for the sections with an odd number of students. Laboratory experiments cover the following topics:
- Electric DC and AC Circuits
- Classic Experiments in Measuring Fundamental Constants (G, g, e, e/m, R, h)
- Magnetic Fields
- Mechanical and Electromagnetic Waves
- Wave Optics
- Particle Physics
- Quantum Physics
- Thermal Physics
