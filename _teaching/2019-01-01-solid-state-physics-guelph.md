#### Role: Instructor

The topics covered in this course include: bonding in solids, thermal and electrical properties of solids, energy bands, imperfections in solids, properties of semiconductors and insulators.

This course deals with crystalline solids and is intended to provide students with basic physical concepts and mathematical tools used to describe solids. The course deals with groups of materials, as in the periodic table, in terms of their structure, electronic, optical, and thermal properties. Specific objectives are:
* To show how crystal symmetry leads to substantial mathematical simplifications when dealing with solids.
* To describe basic experimental measurements, to show typical data sets and to compare these with theory.

Topics included in PHYS *4150*:
1. Free electron metals: Drude theory (classical), Sommerfeld theory (quantum mechanical)
2. The static crystal lattice: Crystal lattices, the reciprocal lattice, X-ray diffraction
3. Electrons in a static lattice: Blochâ€™s theorem, nearly free electrons (NFE), band structure, Brillouin zones
